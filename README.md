# Skribbl Clone 🎨🕹️

A multiplayer drawing and guessing game inspired by [Skribbl.io](https://skribbl.io), built with the MERN stack and Socket.IO.  

Players take turns drawing a given word while others try to guess it in real time. Faster guesses earn higher scores, and the game continues until all players have drawn once.

## Features
- 🎨 Real-time collaborative drawing with canvas sync
- 💬 Live chat with guess validation
- 🏆 Scoring system (faster guess = more points, drawer gets points too)
- ⏱️ Round timer and game flow control
- 👥 Player list with scores and colors
- 🏁 Host rotation, word selection, and round management
